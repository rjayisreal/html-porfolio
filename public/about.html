<h1>Hi there!</h1>
<p>I'm Rj from the Philippines, 26 years of age. I finished a bachelor's degree in Computer engineering. Despite having a good degree, my first job was as an encoder in the Chinese gaming industry. After working there for almost 3 years, I realized that my life was getting nowhere. </p1>
<p>Stocked with the salary I received from my first year, working 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, I started questioning myself if this was the life I wanted for the rest of my life. And then one day, I met my old friend from my school. He is working online, creating a website for his client, and making decent money while having a good life balance, this is when I said to myself, this is the life I wanted to have. That's when I decided to quit my job and start learning how to create a website.</p>
<p>Getting out of your comfort zone is hard, but that just means that you are taking a step towards your better self. Without knowing what the result of the journey is, take risks and do your best. And hope that all hardships will be paid off.</p>
